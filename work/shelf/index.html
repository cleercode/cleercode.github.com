    <p>What do possessions say about a person?</p>
    <p>That's the question we explored with <strong>Shelf</strong>, a social network based around the products that people love. The goals of Shelf were as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Build communities based on product interests:</strong> Products offer a common ground for people who would otherwise be strangers to interact on a level that is engaging and yet not intrusive.</li>
      <li><strong>Supply relevant information about products that extends beyond technical specifications:</strong> For shoppers, some of the most useful information about potential purchases is based on personal experiences, not technical details.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep track and showcase product progression:</strong> Walking through someone's bedroom and seeing their favorite things tells a lot about a person, and this experience can be mirrored in digital form.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We designed Shelf to work as an engaging community by targeting two main user groups:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Enthusiasts:</strong> Product lovers wanting to discuss new releases and how they use their products</li>
      <li><strong>Smart shoppers:</strong> People seeking information about potential purchases</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>The process involved multiple ideation sessions, user interviews and affinity diagramming, paper wireframing, digital wireframing, and development of a prototype. Though I was involved with each stage, my primary contribution was the final prototype, built in HTML and CSS.</p>
