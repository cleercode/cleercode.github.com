    <p>What if maps were smarter?</p>
    <p>One of the small details I love about the Harry Potter universe is a magical map of school grounds called the Marauder's Map that shows people's whereabouts. As far as I can tell, with GPS-enabled smartphones becoming increasingly popular, there's no reason why this idea has to remain magic.</p>
    <p>That's how I came up with the idea for <strong>Waypoint</strong>, a large map displaying a university campus and the anonymous locations of students. Waypoint displays can be mounted at popular public locations around the campus. Students may opt into downloading a simple smartphone application to display their location on these maps.</p>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>The difference between Harry Potter's Marauder's Map and Waypoint is that the Marauder's Map is easily abused for mischief, while Waypoint aims to be fun and helpful, not harmful. The main challenge of Waypoint, therefore, was to take advantage of powerful modern technology without violating privacy. We addressed privacy concerns by making Waypoint a completely anonymous and opt-in product.</p>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>Waypoint was originally conceived as a fun visualization of the college campus, but my team quickly realized that we could use the form factor for additional features like displaying events or walking directions. We developed several feature concepts and gathered feedback from other students about both features and privacy concerns.</p>
    <h2>Feasability</h2>
    <p>Waypoint was designed as a somewhat future-minded concept. The main limitations for implementing a system like Waypoint are simply further ubiquity of GPS-enabled smartphones and improved battery on these devices given frequent data access.</p>
