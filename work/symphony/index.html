    <p>Discovering new music should be easy.</p>
    <p>Tell <strong>Symphony</strong> about a musician you like and it'll suggest others. I worked on Symphony for the 24-hour <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/hacku/" target="_blank">Yahoo! Hack U</a> 2009 hackathon. Symphony was both my first ever web app project, and it ignited my interest in web development. It was also a solo project, so it presented many challenges and lessons.</p>
    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>Symphony uses the <a href="http://www.last.fm" target="_blank">last.fm</a> API to gather data about related artists. Working on Symphony was my first time using JavaScript and jQuery, and I learned the basics on the spot for the hackathon.</p>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>Symphony presents musicians in a tiled photo view. Clicking on a tile opens more detailed information about the musician in a modal windows. This information includes a biography and larger image. I also originally intended to display information like YouTube videos and Flickr photos but ran out of time.</p>
