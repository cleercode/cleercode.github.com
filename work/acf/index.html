    <p>Asian Christian Fellowship is a student organization at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
    <p>This site was designed as a hub for the organization, where newcomers can find out more information about it and members can read about upcoming events.</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>The site uses CSS3 and web fonts to a great degree, with minimal images. I also constructed a Tumblr blog theme for the announcements page to match the static content.</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>With the exception of some minor polishing, the entire design and code process took a day. I spent the day passing iterations back and forth with the fellowship director, who wrote the content for the site.</p>
