    <p>There are so many to-do list applications these days, but I haven't found one that really suits me.</p>
    <p>My dream to-do list application has:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Complete keyboard accessibility</li>
      <li>Some sort of grouping functionality, allowing multiple separate lists</li>
      <li>Due date support with smart interpretation of date strings ("Fri", "tom", "5/27", etc.) and sub-groups based around date ranges</li>
      <li>Accessibility across devices</li>
      <li>A simple, minimal interface that includes these things and not much else</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I found the first three points (especially keyboard support!) pretty well-supported in <a href="http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/" target="_blank">The Hit List</a>, the closest I've found to my ideal to-do list. But besides being costly, it's still overkill for my use. So I built my own to-do list as a web application.</p>
    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>Bonsai was built with <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone.js</a>, which allows task data to be easily bonded to the elements displayed on the page. I also took advantage of <a href="http://www.datejs.com/" target="_blank">Datejs</a>, a JavaScript libary for interpreting date strings.</p>
    </ul>
