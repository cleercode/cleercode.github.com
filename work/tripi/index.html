    <p>Planning a trip can be hectic.</p>
    <p>Going to a new place for a vacation or business trip? Unless you've done your research or know people who've been there, finding out where to go can be tricky. Organizing your ideas and constructing an itinerary can be equally difficult. <strong>Tripi</strong> is designed to solve these problems, simplifying travel planning.</p>
    <p>I worked on Tripi for the 24-hour <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/hacku/" target="_blank">Yahoo! Hack U</a> 2011 hackathon. In 24 hours, three other students (techical students/developers) and I devised and built this travel itinerary planner. I worked all around the project on front-end and back-end development, logo and user interface design, project vision, and team management.</p>
    <p>Centered around simplicity and automation, Tripi provides useful metadata for destinations and suggesting relevant nearby places as the user completes their itinerary.</p>
