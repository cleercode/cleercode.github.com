    <p>Where do you go when you need a lawyer? Real estate agent? Mortgage broker?</p>
    <p>What you may not realize is that plenty of these service providers might be in your local friend group: friends or friends of friends. <strong>Stik</strong> aims to surface these relations by leveraging the Facebook network.</p>
    <p>I interned at Stik during the summer after my freshman year of college, working on front-end development and interface design. The company at that point consisted of three other employees and another intern. It was my first professional job and also my first experience at a startup, and gave me my passion for entrepreneurship. It's also where I learned a lot of the front-end development skills like JavaScript that I now use regularly. As the only designer on the small team, I worked a ton and gained a lot of experience and fond memories.</p>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>When I joined the Stik team, the website looked dated and used an inconsistent color scheme which failed to establish a solid identity for the company. After initially working with a freelance designer to communicate our goals in a site-wide redesign, I took ownership of the redesign project and heavily revised her ideas into something new. We decided to base our color scheme around blue to imply our modern yet reliable system and use of the Facebook network.</p>
    <p>I also designed a new logo for Stik, playing with typography and negative space to show the outline of a suited businessman. Along with a base typeface choice of Gotham Bold, this image was meant to evoke professionalism yet playfulness.</p>
    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>Stik works on PHP and JavaScript, and the internship being my first exposure to web development beyond HTML and CSS. At first, the internship required a lot of requesting help to make sense of code. After a while, I was able to effectively transfer my interface mockups into markup and then program their interactive functionality.</p>
    <p>Since Stik relies on the Facebook network, I spent a good deal of time interacting with the Facebook API.</p>
