    <p>Retro camera effects are hip. HTML5 is hip. So we combined them.</p>
    <p>Apps like <a href="https://instagram.com/">Instagram</a> have repopularized classic camera effects, but these apps are typically limited to closed platforms like iOS and Android. So when the <a href="http://mozappshackday.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">Mozilla Apps Hack Day 2012</a> challenged us to build open, cross-platforms web apps, a couple other Mozilla interns and I decided to build an <strong>Snappy</strong>, Instagram-inspired app. My teammates handled the graphics editing algorithms while I worked on the design and front-end of the app. We ended up completing the app in five hours and winning first place.</p>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>Off the bat, I wanted to use arrange the photo-editing process as a few distinct steps to convey its simplicity. The layout went through many iterations, finally arriving at a main content area with a sidebar displaying the steps. The sidebar's color changes with each step to further demonstrate progress.</p>
    <p>Fitting with the nature of a hackathon, I had to work around various technical limitations as they came up. For example, though we initially wanted to show each effect's result with a thumbnail preview, that feature ended up being infeasible, performance-wise, so I used a text-based list of tabs attached to the photo instead.</p>
    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>Snappy is a simple, client-side JavaScript app. I contributed to the code for front-end interactions, setting up events to trigger when the buttons were pressed or when the app moved to the next step.</p>
    <p>During the hackathon, we didn't concentrate on code style much, so our code became one huge mess. After the fact, I organized and modularized it a bit. The code is <a href="https://github.com/cleercode/snappy" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.</p>
