    <p>The <strong>gospel</strong>, or &ldquo;good news&rdquo;, is the message of God through Jesus Christ that makes up the Christian faith.</p>
    <p>As a Christian, I see this message as of utmost importance. My hope with my attempt here was to use my techical knowledge and design intuition to produce something that clearly, briefly, and beautifully communicates the good news.</p>
    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>The site, designed to use a single page, makes use of some interesting design techniques:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrolling" target="_blank">parallax scrolling</a> technique moves the background images at a different speed than the rest of the site's content while scrolling to simulate 3D</li>
      <li>CSS3's <code>background-size</code> property allows backgrounds images to intelligently resize to cover entire sections. This looks nice with background images based on classic biblical woodcut illustrations.</li>
      <li>The <a href="http://www.zachleat.com/web/bigtext-makes-text-big/" target="_blank">BigText</a> jQuery plugin makes section headers sized to take up the whole width, a technique common in print design but rarely used in web design</li>
      <li>CSS3 animation is used to fade an indicator in when hovering over Bible passages.</li>
      <li>Relevant songs are inserted into each section, powered by <a href="http://www.spotify.com/" target="_blank">Spotify</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>I toyed with the idea of creating a traditional, multi-page website, but decided to consolidate the site into a single, scrollable page. This design encourages the reader to view the content in order, telling the story.</p>
    <p>Although the content was certainly the focus of the page, I wanted it to be visually attractive. I also wanted to clearly distinguish between the main sections of the page, which represent large, distinct periods of time in history. I took the idea of using different colors for the background from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordless_Book" target="_blank">Wordless Book</a>, a Christian evangelistic tool, and modified the color scheme to look more aesthetically pleasing and convey more meaning.</p>
    <p>I wasn't satisfied with solid colors for the background, though, so I attempted to look for some classical Bible art (something I'm rather fond of) to blend into them. I stumbled upon a wonderful, public domain gallery of art Bible illustrations by <a href="http://catholic-resources.org/Art/Dore.htm">Gustave Dor&eacute;</a> and fell in love with it.</p>
