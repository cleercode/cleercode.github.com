    <p>&ldquo;What GPA would I have if I...?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>As a student at Carnegie Mellon University, I've realized two things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Students often want to figure out what grade point average they'd have ahead of time</li>
      <li>Carnegie Mellon's GPA system can be pretty confusing</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Our grading system, like those of many universities, is based around different unit counts assigned to courses, which decide how much a student's course grades factor into his or her overall GPA. It's a simple calculation but can be confusing at first. And even after learning how the grading system works, calculating a GPA can feel unnecessarily tedious.</p>
    <p>These frustrations helped me realize that the grade calculation process could be greatly automated, and I set out to do just that with <strong>Coursel</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>Because of its relatively niche market, Coursel was the perfect opportunity to take risks and experiment with design and development techniques. I took it as an opportunity to practice minimalistic design. I used a color pallette largely consisting of low-contrast grays with red accents to highlight important information.</p>
    <p>On the interaction side of things, I designed Coursel to require a minimal amount of work to complete common tasks involved in GPA calculation. For example, a common desire for students calculating their GPA is to recalculate it with one course grade changed. Coursel allows that in one click: users can simply click on a new course grade and their GPA is recalculated automatically.</p>
    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>I also took Coursel as an initial opportunity to learn how to use <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone.js</a>, a system for structuring front-end JavaScript code. Backbone was helpful because it allows visible elements on the page to be linked to data. When the user changes their course info through the interface, the respective data is updated and a new GPA is calculated and displayed.</p>
    <p>I used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_storage" target="_blank">HTML5 localStorage</a> to store data about the user's courses locally in their browser. Using this method to store data instead of a traditional server was a conscious decision to protect user privacy; I'm sure many students wouldn't be comfortable saving their grades to a server.</p></p>
    <p>After I learned how to use Node.js, I wrote a separate parser for a messy, gigantic HTML spreadsheet of all of Carnegie Mellon's courses in order to create a collect data on the number of units each course is assigned. Node.js made this particularly easy since I could use jQuery to traverse the HTML. In the end, I was able to produce a JSON file that Coursel uses to automatically assign the number of units to a course. Users can click on the unit count (or the course number) to manually change it as well. I thought this work was worth it to refine Coursel and make the process of calculating a GPA just that much more automated.</p>
    <p>I also played around with other technologies like <a href="http://isotope.metafizzy.co/" target="_blank">Isotope</a> to create dynamically positioned tiles to represent courses and <a href="http://coffeescript.org/" target="_blank">CoffeeScript</a> to simplify JavaScript syntax.
