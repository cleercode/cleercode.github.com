      <p><strong>The work has enough love when enthusiasm transfers from the maker to the audience and bonds them.</strong> Both are enthusiastic about the design.</p>
      <p>I can imagine the excitement in the room when Stradivari would hand his newest violin to a skilled musician, because the violinist would <strong>unlock the instrument’s full potential by playing it</strong>. The products of design, like Stradivari’s violins, possess an aspect that can only be revealed through their use.</p>

      <p>The violin-maker has made beautiful instruments, and has called musicians to make wonderful music with them; but the musicians have refused, and have tried to play tunes on bits of scrappy wood and grass they have found lying about the place.</p>
      <p>It is no good the violin-maker wringing his hands and deciding to do without the musicians; they are needed if the violins are to make the music they are supposed to make. He has to set about <strong>rescuing the musicians from their folly</strong>, not just for their own sake (because it’s frustrating and dishonouring for them to try to get music out of lifeless objects) but because <strong>they are needed precisely to make the wonderful music he had in mind all along</strong>.</p>
